Use Directions -

In lab 4 I completed an FSM program using the linked list model.
The program does not produce any errors besides a additional warning. The warning does not effect the program as it only deals with quiting the program itself.

The only restriction to this program will be how you type in your states. When changing the state the chosen state MUST BE A CAPITAL; for example:
c 0 c, with a lower case 'c' will not work. But c 0 'C' wit h a capitalized C will work.

Regarding the test case in the lab manual the program runs the example FSM correctly.
